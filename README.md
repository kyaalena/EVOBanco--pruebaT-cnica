# EVO Senior Backend Developer Challenges
These challenges are meant to test your software development skills. You are free to use Java or JavaScript to solve them.

You have 7 days to reply with your answer, but we expect this challenge to take no more than 2 to 3 hours. We donâ€™t take into account how long it takes for you to respond, ie 2 hours or 22 hours are considered equal.

Your answer will be evaluated based on:
* Correctness, does it work?
* Tests
* Comprehension of the code
* Performance

Your implementation must be your own. Feel free to consult any relevant documentation or doubt related to the challenge.

Please provide a complete solution, including any documentation that we would need to build and run it.
