## Challenge instructions 

These challenges are meant to test your software development skills. You are free to use Java or JavaScript to solve them.

You have 7 days to reply with your answer, but we expect this challenge to take no more than 2 to 3 hours. We donâ€™t take into account how long it takes for you to respond, ie 2 hours or 22 hours are considered equal.

Your answer will be evaluated based on:
* Correctness, does it work?
* Tests
* Comprehension of the code
* Performance

Your implementation must be your own. Feel free to consult any relevant documentation or doubt related to the challenge.

Please provide a complete solution, including any documentation that we would need to build and run it.

## Challenge 1

Holidays at last! As you're walking towards the departure gate of your train, you realize the ticket you were given at the check-in machine is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says sooner rather than later.

Unfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for values in those fields.

As you get to the departure gates area, you see a lot of passengers with confused faces, and as you approach them they tell you they have been given a document with the rules for ticket fields, the numbers on their tickets, and the numbers on other nearby tickets for the same train together into a single document (your puzzle input). However, none of them knows what to do with it.

The rules for ticket fields specify a list of fields that exist somewhere on the ticket and the valid ranges of values for each field. For example, a rule like class: 1-3 or 5-7 means that one of the fields in every ticket is named class and can be any value in the ranges 1-3 or 5-7 (inclusive, such that 3 and 5 are both valid in this field, but 4 is not).

Each ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:


```
.--------------------------------------------------------.
| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |
|                                                        |
| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |
| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |
'--------------------------------------------------------'
```

Here, ? represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as 101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are much more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!

Start by determining which tickets are completely invalid; these are tickets that contain values which aren't valid for any field. Ignore your ticket for now.

For example, suppose you have the following notes:


```
class: 1-3 or 5-7
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50

your ticket:
7,1,14

nearby tickets:
7,3,47
40,4,50
55,2,20
38,6,12
```

It doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid nearby tickets by considering only whether tickets contain values that are not valid for any field. In this example, the values on the first nearby ticket are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three nearby tickets: the values 4, 55, and 12 are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your ticket scanning error rate: 4 + 55 + 12 = 71.

**Consider the validity of the nearby tickets you scanned. What is your ticket scanning error rate?**

## Challenge 2

As you look out the window and notice a heavily-forested continent slowly appear over the horizon, you are interrupted by the child sitting next to you. They're curious if you could help them with their math homework.

Unfortunately, it seems like this "math" follows different rules than you remember.

The homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses ((...)). Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the expression inside must be evaluated before it can be used by the surrounding expression. Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.

However, the rules of operator precedence have changed. Rather than evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the same precedence, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order in which they appear.

For example, the steps to evaluate the expression `1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6` are as follows:


```
1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
  3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
      9   + 4 * 5 + 6
         13   * 5 + 6
             65   + 6
                 71
```

Parentheses can override this order; for example, here is what happens if parentheses are added to form 1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6)):


```
1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))
1 +    6    + (4 * (5 + 6))
     7      + (4 * (5 + 6))
     7      + (4 *   11   )
     7      +     44
            51
```

Here are a few more examples:


```
2 * 3 + (4 * 5) becomes 26.
5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3) becomes 437.
5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4)) becomes 12240.
((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2 becomes 13632.
```

Before you can help with the homework, you need to understand it yourself. 

**Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what is the sum of the resulting values?**
